#' Helper function for getting urls of MODIS fractional cover dataset from the thredds database
#' Catalogue url to browse the server is https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/catalog/catalog.html. To download, have to use https://thredds.nci.org.au/thredds/fileServer/... instead of catalog
#' Product of interest is Rangeland and Pasture Productivity RaPP = tc43
#' some tiles are not .006.nc, they are .061.nc. MODIS v6 discontinued feb2023, and have switched to v6.1. So use v6.1 when available (since 2020. Function automatically replaces with v6.1 for years >= 2020
#'
#' @param mod_h numeric vector of modis horizontal cells of interest
#' @param mod_v numeric vector of modis vertical cells of interest
#' @param years numeric vector of years of interest. i.e. 2001:2024, or c(2020, 2024) etc
#' @returns a character vector of download links
#' @export
